## Concept Drift 

This folder contains the Matlab implementation of the Olindda clustering approach. This is used to clustering monitored behaviours and classifying **normal v. anomalous**. 

Anomalous behaviours are pointed out to the domain expert (policy administrator) and not used for RF learning.
